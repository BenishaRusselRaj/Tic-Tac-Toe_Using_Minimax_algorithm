# Tic-Tac-Toe_Using_Minimax_algorithm

- Minimax algorithm is an algorithm wherein the optimal moves of a player is discovered, while assuming that the opponent also plays optimally.
- It makes use of two players, namely "minimizer" and "maximizer".
- Maximizer provides the best possible score that can be obtained by a player, while playing their best possible moves.
- Minimizer provides the highest score that the player can get, when the opponent plays their best possible moves, aka, the worst possible situation for our player.
